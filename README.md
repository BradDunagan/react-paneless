# paneless

A minimal window manager that may be included in your ReactJS app as a component.

## Warning
Early development. Tried only on Chrome so far.

## Example
Here is a screenshot of an app I am working on that uses this library. This shows one _frame_ with six _panes_ (two of the panes are on tabs so one of those panes is behind the front tab).

## Also an example app in this repository

This repository includes an example app. Here is a screenshot of that app along with other images illustrating features.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save paneless
```
Nope. Don't do that. It won't work, for now.  

Instead, clone this thing down to your machine. Then just play around with the example app.  

Or, if you already have an app you want to include it in, then do -  

```
npm install <paneless-directory>
```  

where \<paneless-directory\> is the directory you cloned this repository to.  

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import MyComponent from 'paneless'

class Example extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <MyComponent />
    )
  }
}
```
