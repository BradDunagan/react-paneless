# paneless

A minimal window manager as a React-JS component.

# warning
Early development. Tried only on Chrome so far.

# Example
Here is a screenshot of an app I am working on that uses this library. This shows one _frame_ with six _panes_ (two of the panes are on tabs so one of those panes is behind the front tab).
